# Quatt-dashboard
Since the 28th of November i own a (Quatt Heatpump](https://referral.quatt.io/l/EDGARVEEN29/). As a Home Assistant user i can not wait to start playing with it. Marco Boers has created a Quatt integration (https://github.com/marcoboers/home-assistant-quatt) so that all available sensors are available inside your Home Assistant. So be sure to take a look into that addon. Without that addon, this dashboard won't work

I really liked the official Quatt app and i like Home Assistant. So i made a first attempt to create a little dashboard inspired by the dashboard from the Quatt app. I am not a novice programmer, and this is my first Github project (i thought it would be the best place to keep all together). This is also my first picture entity i build inside Home Assistant. The chanches are that the configuration i used is not correct or there is a better way to config it. So please let me know.
